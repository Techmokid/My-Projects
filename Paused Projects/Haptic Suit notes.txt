Types of receptors within the somatosensory system:
 - Thermoreceptors:	Temperature												Useful
 - Pain receptors:	Detect an overload of any other sensor. 								Can be ignored completely
 - Propreoceptors:	Rough position of the hand. Used when sight isn't an option. 						Can be ignored completely
 - Mechanoreceptor:
	- Merkel cell nerve endings:	React to low vibration (5-15Hz), hair follacles, and deep static touch.			Might be ignored, unsure
	- Tactile corpuscles:		React to moderate vibration (10-50Hz) and light touch.					Useful
	- Pacinian corpuscles:		React to high vibrations (50-250Hz) and gross touch and texture (rough vs smooth)	Useful
	- Bulbous corpuscles:		React to skin stretch and propreoception. 						Can be ignored completely



Potential solution:
 - Array of custom peltier modules/rods attached to the end of small hydraulic rams.
