Description:
I am sick and tired of not being able to run linux programs on windows and windows programs on linux.
This project is designed to help most if not all windows programs compile to linux and vice versa
The first step is to create a set of files that create a universally understood commandline.
Effectively, take all the possible windows commands, debian commands, ubuntu commands for the terminals, and list them out. Then completely write them from scratch in their respective OS's.
Now that we have a terminal that is completely ignorant of OS, we can start decompiling programs
Once programs are decompiled, they can be refactored, compiled into the target OS, then optimized, we can use the program.
Of course include dependancies.

That way, you can take a windows 10 .exe file, and run it natively via commandline. It will be converted from .exe to whatever the current OS requires, then runs that
