100 trillion connections
100 billion neurons
1k connections per neuron average
15k connections per neuron max

Per neuron:
Max number of connections per neuron at 15,000 connections would require 14 bits to index
Timer var we'll set to be 16 bits per neuron
Therefore neuron init data is 14,16 = 30 bits per neuron

Per connection:
Indexing of 100 billion neurons requires 37 bits per neuron for indexing
Myelination can be a single boolean value
Therefore per neuron connection data is 37,1 = 38 bit per connection

Max neuron data size is 30 + (15k * 38) = 570,030 bits = 570.03kb = 71.254KB
Average neuron data size is 30 + (1k * 38) = 38,030 bits = 38.03kb = 4.754KB

38.03kb per neuron * 100 billion neurons = 3,803Tb = 475.375 TB

PRAM Only:
16 bits per neuron * 100 billion neurons = 1,600gb = 200GB
