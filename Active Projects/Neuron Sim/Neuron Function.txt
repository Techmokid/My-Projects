A neuron happilly sits at -70mV normally (Resting).
If the sum of the input neurons can pull the current neuron above -55mV, the neuron fires in an event called depolarization.
The neuron firing pushes the entire neuron input values to +40mV, where is then starts dropping back down (Repolarization).
Once the neuron hits -70mV, it overshoots a little bit to -75mV, called hyperpolarization.
Over a bit of time, the neuron eventually pulls itself back to -70mV.






Still to figure out, at what point in this process is the neuron ready to refire.
Is it all the way when it's back at -70mV?
Or perhaps the moment it is below -55mV in it's repolarization stage that it can refire?
