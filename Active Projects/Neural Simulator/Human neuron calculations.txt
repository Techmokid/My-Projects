100 trillion connections
100 billion neurons (Technically 86 billion)
1k connections per neuron average
15k connections per neuron max

Per neuron:
Max number of connections per neuron at 15,000 connections would require 14 bits to index (14 bits is 16,384 address indexes)
Timer var we'll set to be 16 bits per neuron
Therefore neuron init data is 14+16 = 30 bits per neuron

Per connection:
Indexing of 100 billion neurons requires 37 bits per neuron for indexing
Myelination can be a single boolean value
Therefore per neuron connection data is 37+1 = 38 bit per connection
Hamming code error detection for 38 bits would need 5 bits, so total 43 bits per connection

Max neuron data size is 30 + (15k * 43) = 645,030 bits = 645.03kb = 80.629KB
Average neuron data size is 30 + (1k * 43) = 43,030 bits = 43.03kb = 5.379KB

43.03kb per neuron * 100 billion neurons = 4,303Tb = 537.875 TB

PRAM Only:
16 bits per neuron * 100 billion neurons = 1,600gb = 200GB
