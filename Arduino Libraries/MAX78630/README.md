## Description
> The EnergyBoard is an energy measurement processor for polyphase power-monitoring 
systems. It is designed for real-time monitoring for a variety of typical three-phase 
configurations in industrial applications. The MAX78630 provides up to six analog 
inputs for interfacing to voltage and current sensors. Scaled voltages from the 
sensors are fed to the single converter front-end using a high-resolution delta-sigma 
converter. Supported current sensors include current transformers (CTs), Rogowski 
coils, and resistive shunts.  
>
> In this Arduino Library we can read all data of energy parameters.
